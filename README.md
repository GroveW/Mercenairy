##Mercenairy: No Mercy In The Air

###*No job's stupid enough when you get paid for it... especially with that choice of machines to get it done!*

####You work as a mercenary on a private airport and you can choose out of plethora of interesting (I hope so) missions. 
####You earn money to buy new aircraft. Before each mission you get to choose machine that you're willing to complete the mission with.
